<h1>Malietoa's Hobbies & Interests</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
    Some of my interests include basketball, going to the gym,
    and learning the piano.

    I have always enjoyed playing basketball. I like to 
    keep up with the nba and some college basketball, whenever
    March Madness comes around.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like to go to the gym at least 3 times a week. It is a habit 
    I picked up after high school as a result of playing sports. 
    I feel the gym is an important part of my life as it helps with my
    physical health goals as well as my mental health.

    A goal of mine has always been to learn to play the piano. I think
    it is one of the most beautiful instruments to listen to, and learning
    it would also help with learning some other instruments in the future.
    Although I am not consistent with my learning right now, I hope in the
    future to be able to master the piano.
